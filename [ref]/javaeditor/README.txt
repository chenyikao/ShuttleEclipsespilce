This is a demonstration of how to create a new Hover control for Eclipse
plug-ins. It requires Eclipse 3.4 or later to compile.  It's been tested only on
Windows XP, but it should work on other platforms with browser support (e.g.,
Mac, Linux.)

This is not a self-contained Eclipse project. To use these files,
you'll need to set up the standard Eclipse sample project named
"org.eclipse.ui.examples.javaeditor", then copy these files into
"org.eclipse.ui.examples.javaeditor\Eclipse Java Editor Example\org\eclipse\ui\examples\javaeditor"
within the project's directory.  (Replace any files that already exist there.)

The code that I've supplied in this demo is in the public domain. The usual
disclaimers apply to these contributions; in particular, they are unsupported
