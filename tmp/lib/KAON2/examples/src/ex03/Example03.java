        // In Example 1, the ontology was browsed by means of utility methods, located on
        // various API classes, such as OWLClass.getSubDescriptions(). This is a very
        // simple API, to be used only for very simple applications.
        // In reality, ontologies can be large. Hence, calling a method which e.g. returns all
        // individuals of a class might be a problem, if there are many individuals.
        // To remedy that, KAON2 provides a special optimized retrieval API, which we discuss next.
        // This API allows to read ontology elements successively, in batches. Hence, if an application
        // sees that there are too many potential results, it can always stop the retrieval.

        // All retrieval is done by means of the Request<T> class. You create a request object
        // in the following way:
        Request<Axiom> axiomRequest=ontology.createAxiomRequest();

        // taking into account axioms which the ontology 'inherits' through inclusion.
        // You do this using Request<T>.size() method. In fact, each retrieval operation has
        // two methods: one which takes information only into this ontology into account (and has no
        // name suffix), and one which takes information from this and all included ontologies into
        // account (and as 'All' suffix).
        System.out.println("Ontology 'example01' contains only "+axiomRequest.size()+" axioms (without taking the included ontology into account).");

        // You may set various parameters on a Request<T> to determine which information you actually want.

        // Now you need to say that you don't want all subClassOf axioms, but only those there
        // the superclass is '#document'. The properties that you use as parameters correspond to
        // the JavaBeans specification. Hence, in class SubClassOf, you have the getSuperDescription() method.
        // According to the JavaBeans specification, this is equivalent to saying that SubClassOf class
        // has a superDescription property. For more details on JavaBeans, please refer to the Java documentation.

        // to Request<T> to retrieve the next window are a significant overhead: on each call,
        // a query will be executed to retrieve a particular window. To remedy that, you can open a cursor
        // over the results. A cursor allows you to access all objects sequentially, but without loading
        // then all at once into a set. This is useful for operations such as export.
        // The method Request.openCursor() exists only in one variant (i.e. there is no "All" variant); i.e.
